querySelector selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.

querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

3. What is Event Bubbling? How does it work?

Event Bubbling means when an event happens on a child element, it moves upward to its parent elements.
It starts from the target element and goes up step by step.

4. What is Event Delegation? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation means adding an event listener to a parent element instead of adding it to many child elements.
It is useful because it saves memory, keeps code clean, and works for elements added later.

preventDefault stops the browser’s default behavior.
stopPropagation stops the event from moving to parent elements.
